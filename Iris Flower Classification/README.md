# Iris Flower Classification
The goal of the project is to put into practice a machine learning model that divides iris flowers into three species based on the traits of their sepals and petals. In the machine learning field, the Iris flower dataset is well-known and frequently used for training classification algorithms.

# Dataset
150 examples of Iris flowers with four characteristics—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—make up the Iris dataset. The iris flower species, the target variable, might belong to one of the following three classes:
1. Setosa
2. Versicolor
3. Virginica
